## 1. What's Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze relationships among multiple variables simultaneously. Unlike univariate analysis, which focuses on analyzing a single variable, multivariate analysis considers the interactions and dependencies between multiple variables. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems and relationships within datasets.

## 2. What are the strengths/challenges
- Strengths:
  - Comprehensive Insights: Multivariate analysis provides a holistic view of data, capturing the interdependencies between variables.
  - Pattern Recognition: It enables the identification of patterns and trends that may not be apparent in univariate or bivariate analyses.
  - Predictive Modeling: Useful for building predictive models by considering the joint effects of multiple variables.
  - Reduced Dimensionality: Techniques like principal component analysis can reduce the number of variables while retaining essential information.
- Challenges:
  - Complexity: Analyzing multiple variables can be complex, requiring a solid understanding of statistical methods and data interpretation.
  - Assumption Sensitivity: Some methods assume certain distributions or relationships, and violations can impact results.
  - Data Quality: Multivariate analysis is sensitive to data quality; outliers or missing values can affect outcomes.
  - Interpretation Challenges: Interpreting results can be challenging due to the complexity of interactions between variables.
## 3. What are the skills
1. Data visualization
2. Supervised learning
3. Unsupervised learning
   
## 4. What are the steps
1. Define Objectives: Clearly outline the goals and objectives of the analysis.
2. Data Collection: Gather relevant data, ensuring it is complete and of good quality.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the characteristics of the dataset.
4. Variable Selection / PCA: Choose variables relevant to the analysis objectives.
5. Model Building: Implement the chosen multivariate analysis model.
